# initialize a deck of cards with the appropriate Python libraries
# and then implement a solitaire game that can be played with the deck.
# The game is played as follows:
#
# 1. A deck of cards is shuffled.
# 2. The top card is drawn and placed in a stack to the right.  The deck is considered stack zero and will be fully discarded.  The stack to the right is the first stack.
# 3. The next card is drawn from stack zero and placed in a stack to the right of stack of the first stack.  This new stack is called the second stack.
# 4. If the rank of the top card in first stack and the second stack are same suit or rank, then the second stack is placed on top of the first stack.
# 5. If the rank of the top card in the first stack and the second stack are not the same suit or rank, then the second stack is placed to the right of the first stack, and the next card from the top of stack zero is drawn and placed to the right of the second stack.
# 6. When there are four or more stacks, any stacks that are either adjacent (next to one another) or are three stacks away from one another (i.e., stack 1 and stack 4, stack 2 and stack 5, etc.) are checked for matching suits or ranks.  If there is a match, the rightmost stack with the matching card is placed on top of the stack to its left.
# 6. Steps 4, 5, and 6 are repeated until all cards are drawn from the deck.
# 7. The game is over when all cards have been drawn from the deck.  The final score is the number of stacks.  The goal is to achieve a single stack.

# help me write a program that does that in Python
# using object-oriented programming principles.
# The program should contain the following classes:
#
# 1. Card: A class to represent a single playing card.  The class should have the following attributes:
#    - suit: A string representing the suit of the card (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).
#    - rank: A string representing the rank of the card (2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace).
#    The class should have a __str__ method that returns a string representation of the card, e.g., "Ace of Spades".
#
# 2. Deck: A class to represent a deck of cards.  The class should have the following attributes:
#    - cards: A list of Card objects representing the cards in the deck.
#    The class should have the following methods:
#    - shuffle: A method that shuffles the cards in the deck.
#    - draw: A method that removes and returns the top card from the deck.
#
# 3. Stack: A class to represent a stack of cards.  The class should have the following attributes:
#    - cards: A list of Card objects representing the cards in the stack.
#    The class should have the following methods:
#    - top_card: A method that returns the top card in the stack.
#    - add_card: A method that adds a card to the top of the stack.
#    - remove_card: A method that removes and returns the top card from the stack.
#
# 4. Solitaire: A class to represent the solitaire game.  The class should have
#    the following attributes:
#    - deck: A Deck object representing the deck of cards.
#    - stacks: A list of Stack objects representing the stacks of cards.
#    The class should have the following methods:
#    - play: A method that plays the solitaire game according to the rules described above.
#    The method should return the final score (number of stacks) of the game.
#
# The program should also contain a main function that creates a Deck object, shuffles the deck, creates a Solitaire object, and plays the solitaire game.  The main function should print the final score of the game.
#
# You can use the following code as a starting point:
#
